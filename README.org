Various c/cpp examples

Files in root dir should compile easily, ie.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
clang -o word-count.out word-count.c
clang++ -o student-class.out student-class.cpp
#+END_SRC
or likewise with ~gcc~

Files in directories will require either a makefile or multiple cli-commands

With emacs, we can use the [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-quickrun][emacs-quickrun]] package.
Example; open ~word-count.c~ and run
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
M-x quickrun-compile-only
# and then run the program in the shell. *OR*
M-x quickrun-arg RET word-count.c u
#+END_SRC
